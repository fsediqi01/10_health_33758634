Outline

This application is a health and fitness tracking system that allows users to add, view and search their daily activities such as running, gym workouts, and cycling. The purpose of the app is to help users monitor their fitness progress by storing essential workout details including date, activity type, duration, calories burned and notes. The application demonstrates the core full-stack skills learned in the Web Applications labs, including routing, form handling, server-side rendering with EJS, and MySQL database integration. The app is deployed on the Goldsmiths server and can also be installed and run locally using Node.js.

Architecture

The application follows a simple two-tier architecture.
Application tier (Node.js + Express): Handles routing, form processing, search logic, and rendering EJS templates.
Data tier (MySQL): Stores all activity data.
Express routes communicate with MySQL using mysql2. EJS renders HTML templates.

User Functionality

The application provides a simple and clear user interface.

Advanced Techniques (optional but useful)

Use of EJS partials for header and footer

Use of MySQL placeholders (?) to prevent SQL injection

Using environment variables with .env

Using modular routing (main.js, activities.js)

Deployment configuration for Goldsmiths VM
